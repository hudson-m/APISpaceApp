# APISpaceApp
This code is part of the hackathon challenge at https://2018.spaceappschallenge.org/, with the theme "The Land Where Displaced People Settle" being chosen. Our goal is to show the user which planting option is the most suitable for his desired location. Currently, our program analyses only temperature (Â°C) and relative air humidity (%).
